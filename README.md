## For the Love of Go:

This repository contains solutions to exercises from John Arundel's [book](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/books/love), "For the Love of Go." It serves as a record of my learning journey and provides potential solutions for others working through the book.

**What you'll learn**

By reading through this book and completing the exercises, you'll learn:

- How to write tests in Go and how to develop projects guided by tests
- How to manage data in Go using built-in types, user-defined struct types, and collections such as maps and slices
- How to write and test functions, including functions that return multiple results and error values
- How to use objects to model problems in Go, and how to add behaviour to objects using methods
- How to use pointers to write methods that modify objects, and how to use types and validation to make your Go packages easy to use

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Go installed and configured on your system. You can find installation instructions on the official Go website: [https://golang.org/doc/install](https://golang.org/doc/install)

2. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   gh repo clone sebwylleman/for-the-love-of-go
   ```

3. **Navigate to the directory:**

   ```bash
   cd for-the-love-of-go
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   Some exercises might require additional packages. In their respective directories, you might find a `go.mod` file indicating dependencies. You can install them with:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

**Exercise Structure**

Each exercise chapter or section might have its own subdirectory within this repository. Inside these directories, you'll find solution files named descriptively.

**Contributing (Optional)**

Feel free to add your own solutions, notes, or improvements as you progress through the book. You can fork this repository and submit pull requests with your contributions.
